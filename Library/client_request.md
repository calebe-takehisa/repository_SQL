# CLIENT REQUEST
The customer requested a table to store the books that are sold. The request is only for books and there is no need to search for other tables. It was then decided to create a MySQL database.
After creating the table, we must deliver some queries ready for them to be sent to the programmer.


#### QUERY

* Bring all the data.
* Bring the name of the book and the name of the publisher.
* Bring the name of the book and the country of the books published by male authors.
* Bring the name of the book and the number of pages of the books published by female authors.
* Bring the values of the books of publishers in Brazil.
* Bring the data of male authors who have had books published in Brazil or Canada
