# Conceptual Data Model
The client **Tera S.A**, requested the modeling of a database to register its customers.
The client wants the scripts to be initially built for the MySQL Database, however, later on, there may be changes in the environment and, consequently, adaptation of the scripts for other DBMS products.
The customer does not want any information regarding sales or inventory, he only wants the primary information from customers.
